# bioRxiv-028274
R analysis scripts and public data for https://doi.org/10.1101/028274

In order to run, the scripts require the following data files

`data/grouse/SG Lek Locations & Descriptors 2016.xlsx`
`data/grouse/SG Lek Observations 1948-2016.xlsx`

which can be obtained from Tom Christiansen of the Wyoming Department of Fish and Game
<tom.christiansen@wyo.gov>.

Once you have the data files, source `run-all.R` in R to replicate the analyses.
